I am pleased to present our project for the fouth year :

Eden Project, a video game, currently in Beta, created on Unity 5 by [Julien Hemmerl√©](http://www.niouhop.com/) (Artist), [Alexandre Meunier](http://alexandremeunier.com/) (Programmer) and myself (Programmer)

After 10 months of development, we released a Beta version of our game.
