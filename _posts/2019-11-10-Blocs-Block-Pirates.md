A game created for the exams during my second year of school.

It is a platform game where the player carries a weapon that shoots blocks: the block gun.
He can interact with the blocks, use them to kill enemies, overcome obstacles, activate switches.
Later in the game, the weapon acquire a new feature: the gravity gun.
The goal is to find all the parts of your spaceship by traversing all levels.

## Features
- Block gun
- Enemy / Boss
- Bonus
- Obstacle / Enigma

The final version of the game was realized in 3 months.

## Constraints
- 60FPS had to turn on the PSP with Fresh Engine.
